 Project Proposal: FC Black Pearl Football Club Management System

 1. Project Title  
FC Black Pearl - Football Club Management System  

 2. Project Overview  
The FC Black Pearl Football Club Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the administrative and operational tasks of a football club. It provides tools for managing players, coaches, finances, matches, and team performance, making it easier for club managers, coaches, players, and fans to access relevant information.

 3. Objectives

3. Financial Management: Track club finances, including salaries, transfer fees, and match revenues.  
4. Match Scheduling: Schedule matches (home/away), track ticket sales, and record results.  
5. Performance Reports: Generate reports on team and player performance.  
6. Fan Engagement: Allow fans to view player stats, match schedules, and stadium details.

- Access stadium details (capacity, location)  

 5. Technology Stack  
- Programming Language: Java (OOP principles)  
- File Handling: Text-based storage (players.txt, coaches.txt, matches.txt)  
- Data Structures: Lists (ArrayList) for storing players, coaches, and matches  
- User Interface: Console-based (Scanner for input)  
- Date Handling: `SimpleDateFormat` for match scheduling  

 6. System Architecture  
The system follows a modular design with the following classes:  
1. Club (Main management class)  
2. Player (Stores player details and stats)  
3. Coach (Manages team formations and strategies)  
4. Match (Handles match scheduling and results)  
5. Stadium (Stores venue details)  
6. Team (Manages team composition and performance)  
7. Fan (Provides fan-accessible features)  
8. Main (Entry point with role-based access)  

 7. Expected Outcomes  
- A fully functional console-based football club management system  
- Efficient handling of player transfers, contracts, and salaries  
- Automated financial tracking (revenue, expenses)  
- Easy match scheduling and performance analysis  
- Improved fan engagement through accessible information  

 8. Project Timeline  
| Phase | Tasks | Duration |

| 4. Deployment   | Final testing, documentation                | 1 week |

 9. Future Enhancements  
- GUI Implementation (JavaFX/Swing) for better user experience  
- Database Integration (MySQL/SQLite) for persistent storage  
- AI-based Team Strategy Suggestions  
- Mobile App Integration for real-time updates  

 10. Conclusion
